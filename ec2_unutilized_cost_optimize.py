'''Explanation:
Create CloudWatch and EC2 Clients: Connect to the CloudWatch and EC2 services in the specified region.
Define Time Period: Set the time period for analyzing CPU utilization (e.g., the last 7 days).
Define Threshold: Set the threshold for underutilization (e.g., CPU utilization < 10%).
Describe EC2 Instances: Retrieve information about all EC2 instances.
Check CPU Utilization: For each instance, retrieve CPU utilization metrics from CloudWatch and calculate the average CPU utilization over the specified period.
Identify Underutilized Instances: If the average CPU utilization is below the threshold, add the instance ID to the list of underutilized instances.
Print Results: Print the list of underutilized instances.'''
